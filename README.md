# This is a static website that we will be able to "post" to with github.
## Intro
So this is another idea for a website. It is very far from done, i.e. there's no real styling.
The javascript is slow and needs an "off" button, for one. But I think it is very promising.

## Static posting / markdown
If you go to the \_posts directory you will see some files with a .markdown type, this is a super simple language that is then converted to html by the site and put
in the appropriate section. In effect, all one will have to do to make a post is create a new file in the \_posts section following the format given in markdown 
it will be included. Look up markdown for more.

The plan is that creating a new file in the correct section will make a new post so blogging becomes super easy.
New pages are created in the same way.

## Sweet blog features
Posts may also include code with syntax highlighting and latex markup (not set up yet).

## CSS / SCSS
The css for the site uses SCSS which is
basiclly a better version of CSS with much needed features, e.g. varibles. It's a superset of CSS so one should be able to pick it up pretty quickly. 
Posts and pages follow a template which will be styled appropriatly. If I say so myself i think the styling is layed out in a super simple way.
