Whether you are an experienced programmer, or never done it before and want to
learn, ProgSoc is a fantastic place to meet likeminded people and have a laugh!

We aim to help people share a hobby of computer programming and hopefully invite
those from all subject areas as it is a hobby that's becoming ever more prominent
in today's technology-driven world. In the short term we aim to host weekly
meet-ups for programming and problem solving hobbyists where we can work on
problems in a group. In the long term we want members to join together to work
on some large projects and have fun whilst doing it. 

We host weekly meet-ups to solve a “problem of the week” for those interested
in programming. Members will have the opportunity to meet new people and learn
or develop their programming skills, whether they are a novice, average or
experienced programmer already.
